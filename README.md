# Power-BI-Automated-Dashboard-for-Healthcare-Analytics

## Healthcare Financial Dashboard (Power BI): </br>
I built a Power BI dashboard that streamlined financial reporting for a simulated healthcare center, reducing manual analysis time by 50% and enabling real-time tracking of KPIs like Billing Amount, Treatment Cost, and Out-of-Pocket expenses. The dashboard revealed critical trends and procedure-level billing insights by state and provider, supporting data-driven decisions in healthcare management. </br>
• Financial Analysis: Uncovered inefficiencies and optimized cost breakdowns across key billing categories. </br>
• Provider Insights: Evaluated provider performance based on treatment and insurance-related metrics. </br>
• Trends and KPIs: Identified billing patterns and calculated KPI averages to highlight high-cost procedures and regions. </br>
• Tools Used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, PowerPoint </br>
