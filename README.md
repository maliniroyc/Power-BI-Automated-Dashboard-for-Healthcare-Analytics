‚Ä¢ Financial Analysis: Uncovered inefficiencies and optimized cost breakdowns across key billing categories. </br>
‚Ä¢ Provider Insights: Evaluated provider performance based on treatment and insurance-related metrics. </br>
‚Ä¢ Trends and KPIs: Identified billing patterns and calculated KPI averages to highlight high-cost procedures and regions. </br>
‚Ä¢ Tools Used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, PowerPoint </br>
